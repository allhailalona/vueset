the prev version of genSvg had issues with the defs of pattern -
the first svg to have defs (the first striped card) would declare global
default settings for all the following striped cards, which would result in
all striped cards having the same colo (as the first one)
I thought the issue is in the decoding (atob for binaries and utf-8 for buffers)
but it was not, the issue was with the final strings, which meant the gen script
had to be modified.
I provided each striped card with a unique id, so it won't declare, neither be
affected from global settings.
this issue took my quite a while to diagnose, and was easier to solve afterwards.

pass cards props from Navbar.vue to Board.vue
map cards from server and display them in a nice table
