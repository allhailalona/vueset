# Set Game Database Structure

1. Cards Database (MongoDB):
   - 81 unique card combinations
   - Each document: 
     ```json
     {
       "_id": "number, shading, color, symbol", //for instance (3sbd - 3 striped blue diamonds)
       "number": 3, 2, 1,
        "shading": "full, striped, empty", //notice I changed the names slightly to avoid confusion
        "color": "purple, green, red"
       "symbol": "diamond, squiggle, oval",
     }
     ```
   - Automatically generated using a script

2. Styles Database (MongoDB):
   - Stores theme-specific image links
   - Structure: 
     ```json
     {
       "_id": "themeName",
       "cards": [
         {"name": "3spo", "link": "https://example.com/theme/3spo.png"},
         // ... other cards
       ]
     }
     ```

3. User Database (MongoDB or Relational):
   - Stores user data, purchases, and game records
   - Structure:
     ```json
     {
       "_id": ObjectId("..."),
       "username": "user123",
       "authMethod": "google",
       "email": "user@example.com",
       "purchases": ["theme1", "theme2"],
       "bestRecord": 42
     }
     ```

Once the game starts:
  - Pass the user's theme selection
  - A 'stack' array is created - a shuffled copy of the theme of choice links database
  - A 'boardFeed' array is created - to which the first twelve objects in the stack array are inserted
  - The array 'boardFeed' is passed to the front, where a new array 'currentBoard' is created as its' copy
  - A 'currentSessionChoices' array is created in the front, upon selecting cards, a new name, derived from the the
    card's object is added to the array
  - When the length of currentSessionChoices is three, it is passed for validation in the backend, iterating through the cardsProperties
    database using the 3 cards names
  - If the validation was successful, a feedback is returned to the front and:
    1. The 3 selected cards are added to the new array 'bin', and removed from the 'stack' array.
    2. The currentSessionChoices in the front is cleared
    3. The boardFeed array in the back is cleared, and the first 3 cards of the 'stack' array are inserted to it, to be passed to the frontend
    4. Upon reaching the front, they are inserted to the currentBoard array, showing on the playing board.
  - If the validtaion wasn't successful, a feedback is returned, and the currentSessionChoices in the front is cleared to reset choices

Once the 'stack' is empty:
  - Game Completed! show results! 
  - Play Again!
