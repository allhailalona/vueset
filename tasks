- store data fetched from cloud after auyth in Redis, and after page refresh, fetch it from redis instead from the cloud to save time
I have decided NOT to imp the above think it's unnecessarily complicated, make sure u include it in the final project notes

- how to view ALL problems from the activitgy bar in temrinal, like with npm run lint? I can't! put it in the final project notes
- make .gitignore work! can't do either....

other tasks:
- final restyling improvements for the far far future:
  1. if u want u can put the stack next to the board, creating a nice animation for dealing and shuffling
  2. u can redesign the stats popup, making the text nicer and actual words with meaning
- of course u need to implement tracking for the speedruns, but this I'll do after multiplayer
- GET requests!


workflow:
1. expo app
2. multiplayer
3. AI for detecting sets
4. final touches plus other tasks
